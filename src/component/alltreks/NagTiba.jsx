        heading='The Nag Tibba Trek is named after the Nag Tibba peak, which is the highest peak in the Nag
        Tibba range of the Lesser Himalayas in Uttarakhand, India. "Nag" means "snake" and "Tibba"
        means "hill" or "peak" in the local language. The name "Nag Tibba" possibly originates from
        the belief that the peak resembles the hood of a snake when viewed from certain angles.
        Additionally, the area surrounding the peak is believed to be inhabited by Nag Devta (Snake
        God) according to local folklore and mythology. Hence, the trek is named after this prominent
        peak in the region.
